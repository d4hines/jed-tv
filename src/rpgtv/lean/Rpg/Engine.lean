# Engine

The Engine rolls all dice and works out every result.
It is pure code: dice come from a seeded random number generator (`Rng`),
so the same seed always gives the same game.
Each step returns Reports (see `Rpg/Report.lean`) that say what happened, with every die face.

A Fight runs in rounds. In each round, every living being acts once,
in order of Basic Speed, then DX. The Character wins any tie that is left.
On its turn, a being chooses a maneuver: Attack, All-Out Attack, or All-Out Defense.
Each Creature always chooses Attack. A maneuver includes at most one attack.
The defender may Dodge, unless its own last maneuver was an All-Out Attack.
