# Adventures

An Adventure is a graph of Scenes. Each Scene has text and a list of Choices.
A Choice leads to another Scene directly, through a Success Roll, or through a Fight.
A Scene with no Choices is an Ending.

An Adventure can also give Theme Names to skills, weapons, and armor, such as "Wand Duelling"
for Broadsword. A Theme Name changes only what the Player sees. The spec and the Engine do not
look at Theme Names.

The types here have no way to say "the Character loses HP" or "the Character dies".
So an Adventure cannot script harm. Harm only comes from a Fight, which the Engine runs.
