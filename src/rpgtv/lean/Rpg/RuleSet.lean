# The rules of one adventure

Each adventure has one `RuleSet` value, in its own `Rules.lean`. The spec, the checker, the
Engine, and the fairness check all get that same value. The default of each field is the
GURPS Lite rule in `Rpg/Rules.lean`, so `{}` means "the rules of this game, unchanged".

A `RuleSet` is part of what "legal" means. People own the `Rules.lean` files: `make check`
fails if a `Rules.lean` is not `{}`, unless a person puts its path on the allow list.
