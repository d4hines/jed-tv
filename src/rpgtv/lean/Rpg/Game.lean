# Game

A `Game` records where play is: on the title screen, in a Scene, in a Fight,
or over. The function `step` in `Rpg/Play.lean` moves a `Game` forward by one input
from the Player. The page sends the inputs; it never changes a `Game` itself.

Only a Legal Adventure can be played. A `Game` holds a proof that its Adventure is legal for
its Character, and a proof that the Character is a legal build. So no code can make a `Game`
from an Adventure that has not passed the checker (or another proof).

This file has only the types. The spec for inputs is in `Rpg/InputSpec.lean`.
