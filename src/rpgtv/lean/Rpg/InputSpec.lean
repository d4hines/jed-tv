# Spec: which inputs the rules allow

The page can send any input. This file says which inputs the rules allow in each game.
`Rpg/Play.lean` proves these things about the Engine:

* `mem_inputs_iff`: the game offers (`Game.inputs`) exactly the inputs allowed here.
* `step_rejects`: an input the game does not offer changes nothing and rolls no dice.

So the Player can do all that the rules allow and nothing else, whatever the page sends.
