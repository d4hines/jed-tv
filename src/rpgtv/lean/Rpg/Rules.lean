# Reusable GURPS Lite types and mechanics

This library supplies reusable GURPS Lite defaults: beings, skills, gear,
point costs, damage tables, and success rolls. Each adventure has its own
`RuleSet` (see `Rpg/RuleSet.lean`) in its `Rules.lean`. Play and the fairness check get that value as an argument.
Page numbers refer to GURPS Lite, Fourth Edition (2020).
The file `docs/gurps-deviations.md` lists each place where these rules differ from GURPS Lite.
