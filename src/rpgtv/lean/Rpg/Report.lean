# Reports

A Report is one thing the Engine did or found out during play, such as a roll or a hit.
The Engine makes Reports, and the page draws them. A Report is data, not text,
so the page can draw each die face and move each HP bar.
Each Report that has dice carries every face the Engine rolled.
A Report keeps the rule data, such as the skill of a roll or the weapon of an attack.
The view (`Rpg/View.lean`) turns these into the Theme Names that the Player sees.
